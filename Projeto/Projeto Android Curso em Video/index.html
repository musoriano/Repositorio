                good feeling for who look at it. Comes up the <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new Mascot for the
                <strong>Android</strong> system.</p>

                the gender for each toilet. People says that the artist was in the <strong>Google's</strong> office when
                she looked the toilet's door and had the idea for the drawing that was simple, clean and objetive.</p>

                desert name on it, in alfabetic order from the version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
